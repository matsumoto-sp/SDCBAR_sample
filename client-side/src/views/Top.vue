      SDCBAR (<strong>S</strong>ecured <strong>D</strong>irect <strong>c</strong>onnection <strong>b</strong>etween <strong>A</strong>pplication and <strong>R</strong>DBMS) is a kind of design pattern that directly issues SQL from client-side JavaScript to server-side RDBMS. This site is an implementation of SDCBAR. Don't think of SDCBAR as a practical design pattern. At the moment this is just an experiment.
