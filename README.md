# SDCBAR Sample

SDCBAR (Secured Direct connection between Application and RDBMS) is a kind of design pattern that directly issues SQL from client-side JavaScript to server-side RDBMS. This site is an implementation of SDCBAR. Don't think of SDCBAR as a practical design pattern. At the moment this is just an experiment.
